        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          As part of the BSCS 633 Internet Application Development course, a
          challenge was held between two groups of 10 members each. Each team
          selected a problem from the first four chapters of Jeffrey C.
          Jackson's *Web Technologies* book and presented it as a challenge for
          the other group to solve. Here's a detailed account of our experience.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Why did you not apply margin on the body tag?

            As a member of Team A-G6 in the BSCS 633 Internet Application Development challenge, my experience was both challenging and enriching. Our team selected a problem from the "Project" section of the 4th chapter of Jeffrey C. Jackson's Web Technologies, and we presented it to the other group. After explaining the problem and its relevance, we spent 15 minutes brainstorming and devising a solution. During the explanation phase, each of us took turns walking through the flow diagram and the code we developed. The Q&A session that followed tested our understanding and ability to defend our solution, and we were able to successfully counter the tricky questions posed by the other team. The challenge also gave us an opportunity to analyze the other team's approach, and after completing the task, we answered five follow-up questions. It was a rewarding experience, where I was able to showcase my problem-solving skills and collaborate effectively with my team. Ultimately, it was a great learning opportunity, and I felt proud of our performance.

            I spent 5-6 hours  learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it was an eye-opening experience. I discovered that I could view a website on my phone by using its IP address while connected to the same network, instead of relying solely on inspect elements. Working with a team where everyone brought unique skills made the process highly efficient and enjoyable. This experience has further motivated me to pursue web development as a career, especially as I continue learning the MERNstack.
